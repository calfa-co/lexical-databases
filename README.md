## Enriched Dictionaries of Classical and Modern Armenian

* üìå **The dictionary**: https://dictionary.calfa.fr/
* About the origin story of the dictionary: https://calfa.fr/about

This repository contains the raw files of the lexical databases for the Classical Armenian-French-English dictionary, known as Calfa.fr. The dictionary includes in total **65,430 entries** with **155,000 examples** from **400 different sources**, such as Armenian historiography, the Gospels, and liturgical books. It also includes proper names from Classical Armenian literature and synonyms. 

The dictionary is a compilation, standardization, and update of multiple reference dictionaries (see the list of references below). For a description of the methodology, refer to the "To cite this work" section. It mainly consists of Classical Armenian headwords, but the databases also contain multiple middle or pre-modern forms and translations, indicated by an asterisk (*).

These data can be freely used under a [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

The dictionary was originally digitized and OCR-processed (manually proofread) by the Calfa Team from 2014 to 2017, with support from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the Foundation of the Ghoukassiantz Brothers.
